const VS let (let's all forget about var)

```
//Variables essentially a cell or container where we can store our data.
//Accessing those data is as simple as referencing the variable name.

//To properly do this; we first need to declare the variable. This helps the browser allocate some memory for each variable.
//To declare a variable we have to either use the const or let key word.
//From there we can either assign them a value or leave the variable empty


//Let's create a varialbe with const
const variableName1 = 1;
//And print its value
console.log(variableName1); //Prints 1
```
