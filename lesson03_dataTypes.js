//Now we are ready to go over primitive data types, which represent that different
//types of data our variables can hold as their value

//The main ones include 

//Numbers
const day = 5;
console.log(typeof day); //Prints number
//Strings
const name = 'Panos';
console.log(typeof name); //Prints string
//Booleans represents either true or false value
const isLogged = true;
console.log(typeof isLogged); //Prints boolean
//Undefined represents a variable that a value hasn't been assigned to it yet
let emptyVariable;
console.log(emptyVariable); //Prints undefined
//Null represent a variable that an empty value has been assigned to on purpose
let minute = null;

//We also have symbol and object, but more on those later

/*
    Please note that javascript at its core is an object oriented programming language
    Essentially everything in javascript is an object. Even a variable of type number with
    a value of 5, in the end is just an object of type number. More on this later
