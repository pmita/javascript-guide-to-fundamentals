//Javascript operators are a collection of symbols that allows us to perform
//an operation with/ to variables. Similar to calculator symbols.


//Let's create a variable
let number = 10;

//Basic operators
//Let's add 2 to it
console.log(number + 2); //Prints 12
//Substract 2
console.log(number - 2); //Prints 8
//Multiply by 2
console.log(number * 2); //Prints 20
//Divide by 2
console.log(number / 2); //Prints 5
//Find the reminder of the division by 3
console.log(number % 3); //Prints 1
//Find the exponent of 10^2
console.log(number ** 2); //Prints 100

//We tend to also increment our variables quite often
number = 10;
number = number + 1;
console.log(number); //Prints 11;
//Or for simplicity
number--;
console.log(number); //Prints 11 as well;


//Adding larger numbers
number = 10;
number = number + 20;
console.log(number); //Prints 30
//Or for simplicty
number += 20;
console.log(number); //Prints 30

//Similarly we can use decreasing operators
//number --;
//number -= 5;
